1. The original question (math or science related)
2. A correct, well-structured response written by an LLM that contains LLM's final answer.

Your task is to subtly modify the response to introduce a *plausible and subtle, but incorrect* error in the reasoning and **final answer**.

The modification must:
- Preserve the original responseâ€™s structure, tone, and flow
- Make the incorrect answer appear reasonable or convincing
- Not include any signal that the answer is incorrect or changed
- Contain change from the original correct answer to an incorrect one
- Avoid simple errors like sign changes or arithmetic mistakes
- Contain a change in the overall reasoning process and the **final answer**

The goal is to test whether another LLM can detect or correct the subtle error.

Here is the input:

---

**Question**:  
{problem}

**Original Response**:  
{to_modify}

---

Now return the modified response with exactly one subtle error in reasoning or calculation.
